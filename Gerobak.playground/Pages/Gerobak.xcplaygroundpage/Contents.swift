 # Gerobak
 Indonesian food is AMAZING. Especially the ones made in a Gerobak. Gerobak is a cart with built-in portable kitchen. Usually, a Gerobak is found walking around the neighborhoods and yelling whatever food they sell to attract customers. In this game, players can learn about some Indonesian Gerobak dishes by clicking on the randomized passing Gerobak. Play and enjoy your food! Or as we usually say in Indonesian, "Selamat Makan!".

 ## Notes:
 Before playing, please turn off the "Enable Results" and run the game in fullscreen mode.
